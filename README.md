### Abstract


The necessity of storing and manipulating electronic data (eHealth data) in the Oncology research field has introduced two main types of challenges. Firstly, research centers need to manage eHealth data with appropriate and secure Data Management Infrastructure, and secondly, to preserve the privacy of patients' data. 
This work consists of a study on the feasibility and privacy analysis of a Data Management Infrastructure in the Oncology Research Domain. The project studies potential strengths and weaknesses in developing a Digital Clinical Data Repository (DCDR) in a practical study case at “Centro di Riferimento Oncologico” in Aviano, Italy. The study considers the standard HL7 FHIR, an international standard for healthcare data retrieval and exchange, within two possible scenarios, a monolithic application and a fragmented one. The analysis of potential privacy-related aspects is examined within the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework and studied through a utility evaluation after applying Differential Private mechanisms.
